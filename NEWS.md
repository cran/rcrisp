# Version 0.1.4 - 2025-07-04

## Added

- The CRAN badge has been added to the README.
- DOI is added to CITATION.cff, DESCRIPTION and README (badge)

## Fixed

- `check_cache()` is only run when the package is attached, not when it is loaded to avoid namespace issues.

## Changed

- Vignette file names are updated to ensure they are listed in order on CRAN.

# Version 0.1.3 - 2025-06-27

## Fixed

- Tests retrieving DEM data from AWS have been either removed or mocked to avoid issues with the AWS API.
- Warnings in delineation tests are safely suppressed.

# Version 0.1.2 - 2025-06-26

## Changed

- The default cache directory has been moved to the path given by `tools::R_user_dir()`.
  Checks for the cache directory size and outdated files are now included on package load.
- Tests in `test-delineate.R` and `test-osmdata.R` have been partly rewritten, so that they use less resources and they complete in a reasonable amount of time.
